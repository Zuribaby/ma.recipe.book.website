Pair Project: Recipe Book Website
Objective:
Create a simple web application to display different recipes. The application should have at least two pages – a main “Recipes List” page and a “Recipe Detail” page. Each recipe item on the list should link to a detail page, where more information about the recipe is displayed.

Requirements:

Recipes List Page:
This is the main page where all the recipes are listed.
Each recipe item should display at least the title and a short description.
When the user clicks on a recipe item, it should navigate to the Recipe Detail page for that specific recipe.
Recipe Detail Page:
This page should display more detailed information about the recipe such as ingredients, preparation steps, and a picture if available.
There should be a back button which navigates back to the Recipes List page.
State Management:
You should have a state for the list of recipes. Each recipe should be an object with properties such as title, short description, ingredients, preparation steps, and a picture URL.
The state should be managed using the useState hook.
Routing:
Use React Router to manage routing in the application. The Recipes List should be at the “/” path, and each Recipe Detail page should be at the “/recipe/:id” path, where id is the unique identifier of each recipe.
Tips:

Start by creating your static components and setting up your state. Then, add interactivity by connecting the state with the components. Finally, setup your routing.

This project is an excellent way to practice your React skills, including component creation, state management with hooks, and routing with React Router. It touches upon most of the fundamental concepts in React. Remember, the key to learning is practising, so keep coding and experimenting!
